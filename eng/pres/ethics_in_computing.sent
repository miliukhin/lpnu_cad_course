Goals
  - showcase problems
  - find solutions

Outline
  1. Piracy
  2. Digital Restrictions Management
  3. Proprietary software
  4. Conclusion


PIRACY 🏴☠️

Digital piracy != real piracy

@pirate.jpg
it's not like these guys are going to
come and take over your dev office

+ 🍎 → . vs 🍎 → 🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎
+ piracy increases popularity

It still may seem unethical, until
we look at piracy mitigation

DRM

DRM limits what
people can do
with digital media

@toilet.png

Examples of DRM

1. Amazon deleted 1984
ebook from people's devices

2. Windows media player stopping
when users started a program that
could record audio.

Sony and friends are
suing Internet Archive now.
                Guess why?

@sinatra.webp
he didn't die, he became a part of sony legal team
posting of thousands of old songs
and recordings online amounts to
“wholesale theft” of
copyright-protected music.

3. game DRM
   No internet (earlier CD)
   → no single player? 🤔

4. Cars nowadays
   - Paid seat heating
   - software speed limit

5. Netflix restricting
   accounts to 1 IP

6. Movies, music, games, alright!
But SCIENCE?

Why ever make a study
inaccessible?

researchers *don't*
earn from paywalls

So piracy
may be unethical,
but DRM is the devil.

DRM is
overengineering

How to give back?

Buy merch
support the author
# not spotify charts

Seed, please 🌱
so others feed

SCRAPING 🕷️

Scraping is gathering
info from websites
(often automated)

@scraping.png
it is common practice,
and often has a good purpose,
even if site owners don't like it.

+ search engine indexing
+ data preservation
+ efficient use of the web

scraping GOOD

When you're
scraping

Totally ethical:
- don't switch user agents / IPs
- describe your doing

Easy to block

then, a resource
goes down

and with
no scraping...

⬜

PROPRIETARY
SOFTWARE 🚫

Non-libre software
doesn't respect users

what is
freedom
   ?

@0.png
Let's look at software freedoms
to better get why.

@1.png

@2.png

@3.png

0. Run.
1. Study and modify.
2. Redistribute.
3. Modify + Redistribute.

but with
non-free software...

Users ⇒ Uses

- users are often tracked for 💰
- and tricked
- face security issues
- rely on the developer
- ...

And these proprietary software
companies often use dark patterns
and sneaky marketing

like google
sabotaging firefox

@trackers.png
definitely privacy settings!

But can they really
be turned off?

November 2020 → malware sending
(unencrypted) reports what user
opens what program to Apple.

It also gives
Apple power to
sabotage users' computing.

Is THIS ethical?

What if
the web ran
on this ?

@babiichuk-devil-eula.svg
Unfortunately, user space
is plagued with it, but

Conclusion

1. There are many
injustices in the
digital world

2. Sometimes physical
world rules
           don't apply

3. There are
solutions

https://www.defectivebydesign.org/
there's a guide that lists
services without DRM

Are these ethical?

unethical
cracking

client-side
execution
on the web

HR
?

software
bloat

EARN IT
Act

yeah please
ban encryption
